‚öôÔ∏è Backend Engineer @ Oracle | System Design ‚Ä¢ Distributed Systems ‚Ä¢ Scalable Infra

I build high-performance backend systems powering 1M+ transactions/day ‚Äî from microservices and caching layers to event-driven data pipelines. At Oracle, I‚Äôve led key migrations from monoliths to microservices, optimized ingestion pipelines, and improved performance 4x under load.

I‚Äôve also built side projects like ElasticSync (CDC with Kafka + Debezium + Elasticsearch) and Cache++ (Redis-style in-memory DB in C++ with sharding, replication).

Tech I use daily: Java, C++, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Docker, REST, SQL, System Design.
